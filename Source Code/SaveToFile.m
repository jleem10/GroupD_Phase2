%SAVETOFILE: Function To Save Simulation Data To A Text File.
% 
% Takes in a CELL, 'Data', whose elements are STRUCTS. Each of these
% STRUCTS corresponds to the simulation data for a different value of the
% sweep parameter.
%
% i.e. Data{1} gives the simulation data for the minimum value of the sweep
% parameter.
%
% Each of the STRUCTS contained within 'Data' contains two elements, t and
% Y. Data{Index}.t is a COLUMN VECTOR containing a list of time values of
% the simulation. Data{Index}.Y is an ARRAY where each column corresponds
% to a different simulation parameter for the corresponding time value in 
% Data{Index}.t. Columns in Data{Index}.Y correspond to V(Viral), H(Healthy),
% I(Infected), M(Antigen-Presenting), F(Interferon), R(Resistant), E(Effector),
% P(Plasma), A(Antibodies), S(Antigenic Distance), D(Dead Cells).
%
% Also takes in a STRING 'FileName' which is the file to which the data will
% be saved. Should be in the form ***.txt.
